Using music and theatre to bring to life the poetry and texts of poets and writers of that time along with oral histories and testimonials of survivors of the Partition. Many of the stories we have heard from our grandparents will be lost with the passing of the older generation and this performance is an attempt to preserve and honour them and to serve as lessons for generations to come. In revisiting these stories through music and theatre, Sonam Kalra hopes that the audience will be able to empathize, ponder and realize the way forward. Hopefully, a way of peace and co-existence based on a shared grief, a shared loss, a shared history and a shared love.",
